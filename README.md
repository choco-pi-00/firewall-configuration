# 🔥 Firewall Configuration & Testing (Windows + Linux)

Welcome to the **Firewall Configuration & Testing** lab — where we politely tell unwanted traffic to "go away" 🚪💨.

## 🧠 Why This Repo?
Because firewalls are like bouncers at a club — if your name’s not on the list, you’re not getting in.  
And if you *are* on the list, we might still check your ID. 😉
